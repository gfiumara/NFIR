## Windows
Build output may be redirected to any convenient dir by utilizing the '-B' switch for the 'cmake' command.
For the Windows examples below, build output is redirected to RAMDRIVE (R:\).  A nice tool to create RAMDRIVE for
Windows is OFSMount (osforensics.com).

From this 'build' subdir, open PowerShell terminal:

NFIR lib and bin:
cmake -S .. -B R:\NFIR -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Release" -D_WIN32_64=1
MSBuild R:\NFIR\NFIR_ITL.sln

Library files are located here on successful build:
R:\NFIR\src\lib\Release\NFIR_ITL.lib
R:\NFIR\src\bin\Release\NFIR_bin.exe


## Linux
In a terminal, navigate to the 'build' subdir:

NFIR lib and bin:
cmake ..
make

Library files are located here on successful build:
./src/bin/NFIR_bin
./src/lib/libNFIR_ITL.a
